    Topic Description
  </h1>

  <p>
    For this project we will be creating an interactive music environment website. Similar to the idea of
    <a href="https://www.bigbluebubble.com/home/games/my-singing-monsters-series/my-singing-monsters/">"My Singing
      Monsters"</a>
    where the user is able to interact with a song by messing around with its individual elements. From instraument to
    instraument
    the user would be able to add and take away as they so pleased creating their own sound. However, to make this
    interesting,
    by adding a new sound they would also be adding a specific color to the UI. The more elements the more colors and
    visa versa with
    subtracting elements. Not only in this sense will the user be able to play around with what they hear but also
    what they see,
    hopefully not just creating something pretty to hear but also to see.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason for developing this app is really quite simple. To not only create a profile for the wonderous Ken
    Norton but to
    do it in such a way that the user will be so enamored with what they see and hear that they will have to follow
    Ken on
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> (where his music shall be sourced) but also tell all their
    friends and family
    creating a launching pad for his new carrer as a nationwide artist.
    In seriousness, and to put things bluntly, this website's purpose is to help share the music that Ken makes and
    what better way
    to do it than by creating a web application that is fun and intriguing for the listener. While not exactly
    answering any known
    problems or filling a space in the internet that has yet to be filled, this website would be a proof of concept
    that not only a
    group of CS majors can create something more than errors and frustration but also that a personal portfolio can be
    more than your
    basic html with links. By this we hope to bring a smile to someones face and crease on their forehead as they put
    effort into
    trying to find new ways of enjoying a song.

    Potential Applications
  </h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>What is the App's purpose?</dt>
    <dd>- This apps purpose is to show off Ken's skills as a musician while being the stepping stones for his
      online prescence and hopefully successful hobby.
    </dd>
    <dt>How would someone use it?</dt>
    <dd>- Someone would use this by choosing one of his songs based on the provided library (created from an
      <a href="https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide#uploading"> API such as this)</a> and then create
      their own tune
      by dragging and dropping or removing colors from the UI. Doing so would add or drop elements of the song
      creating its own unique
      sound
    </dd>
    <dt>Why would it be useful?</dt>
    <dd>- In practical terms this web app would not have much use at all. In unpractical terms, the use would be most
      akin to enjoyment
      of music. Just as Spotify and other music based companies provide their sound on the internet for others
      enjoyment this app would be
      doing the same albeit in a different manner and hopefully a more memorable one at that.
