      <h1 id="first-h1">How does the Game work?</h1>
      <p>
    This game works by dragging and dropping the different musical elements into the user interface. First you will
    need to select
    a song. Once you have, the buttons should be usable. Choose which element you would like to use and then place it
    in the ui.
    If you would like, keep in mind what color you are choosing, that way you can create a beautiful gradient with the
    elements that
    you are choosing. If you would like to take a way a color/musical element, simply grab the corrosponding color in
    the ui and drag
    it outside the box. By doing this you should be able to take away the element and color.

      <h1 id="ss">How to Select a Song</h1>
      <p>
    In order to select a song, a lovely link has been placed at the top of the webpage which when pressed will direct
    you somewhere.
    Once there you will be given a couple of options that you can listen to. Select the one you have decided you would
    like to mess
    around with and then hit okay. Congratulations, you have successfully selected a song.
      </p>

      <h1 id="sg">How to Select your Gradient</h1>
      <p>
    In order to select a beautiful gradient, another lovely link has been placed at the top that when presses will ask
    you to input
    your start color stated by its hex code to your last color also stated by the hex code. If you don"t know the hex
    code for the
    color in your mind, a simple google search should be able to fix that problem. Once the two hexcodes are inputted,
    hit okay, and
    from there your gradient should show up on the web page.

    <div class="item">
      <h1 id="dd">How to Drag and Drop</h1>
      <p>
    Dragging and dropping should be the simplest part of this web app. Left clicking and while holding down your left
    click drag
    your mouse to the big white box. Once there let go of your left click and the color should be added to the
    interface. If you
    would like to take away an element/color simply repeat the first step but drag the color outside the interface and
    let go. This
    should get rid of what you would like to get rid of.
